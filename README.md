# Bird-Window-Collision-Death-Visualization
Plotly data visualization tool can help raise awareness of the issue of bird-window collisions and facilitate efforts to mitigate their impact.


Bird-window collisions occur when birds fly into windows, often mistaking reflections for open space. These collisions can be fatal, and they are a major threat to bird populations worldwide. To help understand the scope and location of this issue, several initiatives have used data visualization tools such as Plotly to create maps and databases of bird-window collision incidents.

For example, the Fatal Light Awareness Program (FLAP) has created an interactive map of bird-window collisions in Toronto, Canada, using Plotly. This map allows users to explore the location and frequency of bird-window collisions across the city. Similarly, the Birdsafe Building Program in New York City has used Plotly to create a map of bird collisions with buildings in the city, as well as a dashboard for tracking bird collision data in real-time.

By using Plotly to create interactive visualizations, researchers and conservationists can gain valuable insights into the patterns and causes of bird-window collisions. These insights can help inform efforts to prevent these collisions and protect bird populations. Potential solutions include installing bird-friendly glass, using window films or decals, and modifying lighting practices to reduce the likelihood of collisions.
